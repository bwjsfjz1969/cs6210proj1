Examine the version of the producer-consumer code provided in the instructor notes and
answer the following questions.  You may have to copy and past into a
text editor to see the line numbers.

1. The main function contains calls to exit() (line 57) and
pthread_exit() (line 65). How will the effect of these two calls
differ when they are executed?



2. The main function calls pthread_join() (line 62) with the parameter
thread_return. Where does the value stored in thread_return come from
when the consumer_thread is joined?



3. Where does the value stored in thread_return come from if the joined
thread terminated by calling pthread_exit instead of finishing
normally?



4. On the same call to pthread_join() (line 62), what will it do if the
thread being joined (consumer_thread, in this case) finishes before
the main thread reaches the that line of code (line 62)?



5. In this program, the main thread calls pthread_join() on the threads
it created. Could a different thread call pthread_join() on those
threads instead? Could a thread call pthread_join() on the main thread
(assuming it knew the main thread's thread ID - i.e. pthread_t)?



6. The consumer_routine function calls sched_yield() (line 148) when
there are no items in the queue. Why does it call sched_yield()
instead of just continuing to check the queue for an item until one
arrives?
